Details of the design for new file creation

Accept as input
	phenotype.txt
	file with read counts
	criteria for classification and filtering

Output would be 2 files :
	transcript read count for each of the filtered samples
	output labels for each of the filtered samples


For eg :

i/p read count file

    t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6
s1
s2
s3
s4
s5
s6



phenotype.txt

Sample     Age Gender Technology    GBMVsControl     GBMVsGlioma
s1    60    M    Microarray    GBM     GBM
s2    65    M   RNASeq        GBM     GBM
s3    59    F    RNASeq        Control NA
s4    55    F    Microarray    NA        Glioma
s5    50    M     RNASeq        Control NA



Now if 
criteria for filtering is Age > 55
and criteria for classification is GBMVsControl



o/p files will be 


1.)
filtered samples read count
    t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6    
s1
s2
s3



2.)
filtered samples output label    
s1    GBM
s2    GBM
s3    Control


    In phenotype.txt, currently including these attributes

Sample
Sex
Age
CancerType
Mutant
Technology
Biomarker                 (EV miRNA or EV lncRNA or platelet mRNA or ...)
Cancer Vs Healthy
CancerType1 Vs CancerType2
CancerType2 Vs Healthy
Dataset Id                 (in case we plan to combine multiple datasets)
â€‹
    the classification criteria, Cancer Vs Healthy, CancerType1 Vs CancerType2 etc, can be specific to each cancer type.
As filtering criteria, include only : Sex, Age ... Biomarker, DataSet Id
